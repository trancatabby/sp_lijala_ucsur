<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Lijala is a personal radical keyboard I made for typing <a href="https://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/charts/sitelen.html">UCSUR sitelen pona.</a> Like another toki pona keyboard, <a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/sp_wakalito_ucsur">nasin Wakalito,</a> it uses radicals (recurring pieces of glyphs) to type words. <em>Un</em>like Wakalito, however, it was designed for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Be as simple to type as possible. In Lijala, words should (hopefully) take less keypresses than in Wakalito. This was my main problem with Wakalito itself, and I aim to solve it with Lijala.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Be fluid. Every step to making a word should be another word. This one was just a goal of mine so I could save as much space as possible, and it was a pain to implement until I remembered deadkeys exist.</li>
</ul>
